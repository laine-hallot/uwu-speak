# UwUScript

Furry UwU speak JavaScript/TypeScript.

This is project is a work in progress.

## Development

The package names here will change

- `uwu-parser/` fork of `@babel/parser` that can recognize UwUScript syntax. https://github.com/laine-hallot/uwu-parser
  - this one is going to remain a git submodule until I figure out a better workflow
- `uwu-script/` UwUScript syntax highlighting plugin for VsCode
- `uwu-speak/` Babel plugin that enables the UwUScript parser
